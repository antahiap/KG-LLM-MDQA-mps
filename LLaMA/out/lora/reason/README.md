The folder should contain:

* **iter-51199-ckpt.pth**: ckpt for llama2 when training after 51199 iterations
* **lit-llama-lora-finetuned.pth**: final ckpt for llama1

You can download them in the Dropbox. Note that these ckpts are only for the fine-tuned lora-weights. For the original Pre-trained LLaMA(2) weights, please follow instructions [here](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-llama) for LLaMA and [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) for LLaMA2 to download and access
